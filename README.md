To run the program, navigate to FizzBuzz.zip\FizzBuzz\bin\Debug\net6.0 and open FizzBuzz.exe (note you have to extract the FizzBuzz folder from the .zip folder so it has all needed dependencies)

To run the unit test, using Visual Studio, navigate to FizzBuzz.zip\FizzBuzzTest and open FizzBuzzTest.sln. This will open the project in Visual Studio. You can right click on FizzBuzzUnitTest.cs and click “Run Tests”
